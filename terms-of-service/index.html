<h2 id="13-general-provisions">13. General Provisions</h2>
<p><strong>13.1 Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement, or any of a party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, to
any third party without the other party’s prior written consent, which consent
must not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however,
that the Company may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, (a) to a
successor-in-interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
a sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or other change of control, or
(b) to a affiliate.</p>
<p><strong>13.2 No Partnership.</strong> Nothing in the Agreement is intended nor shall be
deemed to create any partnership, agency or joint venture relationship by or
between the parties.</p>
<p><strong>13.3 Severability.</strong> Should any part or provision of this Agreement be held to
be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will
nonetheless remain valid. In this case, the invalid or unenforceable provisions
shall be replaced by a substitute provision that best reflects the economic
intentions of the parties.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 Applicable Law.</strong> This Agreement and all claims arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement (including all claims arising out of contract,
tort, or unjust enrichment) are in all respects governed, construed, and
enforced according to the substantive laws of Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>13.5 Jurisdiction.</strong> The courts at the registered seat of the Company have
exclusive jurisdiction for any and all disputes arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement.</p>
